This visualization takes a step back and looks at overall usage between genders and weekday, rather than by hour. Data is also divided into Customer and Subscriber- differentiating those who hold annual subscriptions and those who may be tourists using Bikeshare on vacation.

## Summary:

Additionally, we can look at how age plays a role in Bikeshare usage, as well as a deeper look into how to rotate out bikes that are more frequently used for ones that get less use, to keep the overall fleet level. We can see from the visualizations previously made when low usage times are and can schedule maintenance and rotation during these times, as well as other business upkeep. 

We can then take what we learned about the who, what, why, when, and where and see if the same model will apply to the Des Moines location.
